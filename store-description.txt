Strims GG extension for displaying a user's favorite channels, what's currently live, and enable quick access to open up live streams on the Strims.gg site.
Strims GG is a browser extension for Google Chrome that makes it easy to check which of your favorite Strims.gg channels are currently live.

Extension developed by strims community members including: NomDePlume.

Once the extension has been installed it will place a small monitor / TV icon on the top right of your browser window.
This icon will show a badge to indicate the number of streams which are currently live.
Upon opening you will see the list of streams available to watch, their viewer counts, who is streaming and the title of their stream.

You can then view which of your favorite Strims.gg streams are online by clicking the Strims GG icon in the browser window.

This extension does not stream or show any content itself, it is purely a mechanism that uses developer approved api's to create a link listing of what is available on the site to view.

Future Releases:
- Configure the extension to send you a notification when one of your favorite streams goes online.
- See the strims calendar to make sure you don't miss upcoming events
